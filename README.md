## ABSTRACT
</div>
<div align="justify"> 
Analyzing the biological signals our brain generates in response to external visual cues might shed the light on the elicited neurophysiological modifications in the nervous system that leads to the  emergence of biological states known as emotions. Currently there is no analytical  model that can fully describe  the processes in the human brain associated with emotions and can provide a reliable approach for reverse engineering of the biological signals into emotional states. However, several Machine Learning and Deep Learning technics are capable to infer emotions from biological signals with high accuracy.  In comparison to analytical model, the  trained ML model or network acts as a black box, i. e. it does not provide  enough information about the hidden processes in human brain that are associated with the emotional state. The convolutional networks offer a  prostpective approach towards creating interpretable models for human emotion recogintion. The feature maps  generated in the hidden layers might shed a light on the bilogical signal features that can be associated with positive or negative emotions. In this project we focus on interpretablility of the  models for human emotion recognition from the electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of neural activations elicited by visual stimuli. We conduct a visual analysis of the feature maps extracted by the hidden layers of two CNN models and conclude on frequency ranges that the model uses to differentiate between four emotion categories. Then we  propose  a modification of the currently existing model leading to the  improvement of recognition accuracy. We also investigate the original data in order to eliminate outliers affecting the classification accuracy. Finally, we propose a pipeline for analysis of the EEG data for emotion classification.
